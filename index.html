    <h3>Lehigh University Class of 2024, Political Science and Journalism major.</h3>
    <p>I am orignially from the South Coast of Massachusetts, and I have had six family members attend Lehigh in the last two generations, including my mother, grandfather, and aunt and uncles.</p>
    <p>I came to Lehigh originally as a Computer Science major, but I changed course to Political Science and Journalism after one year. Those subjects are where my passion truly lies.</p>
