    <h1>Brendan Rego</h1>
    <h3>Lehigh University Class of 2024, Political Science and Journalism major.</h3>
    <p>I am orignially from the South Coast of Massachusetts, and I have had six family members attend Lehigh in the last two generations, including my mother, grandfather, and my aunts and uncles.</p>
    <p>I came to Lehigh originally as a Computer Science major, but I changed course to Political Science and Journalism after one year. Those subjects are where my passion truly lies.</p>

    <h3> Where do PA Senate candidates get their money? </h3>
    <p>That is the question I was attempting to answer by looking into the campaign finance data of the top Democrat and Republican candidates in the upcoming general eleciton this fall</p>
    <p>The most jarring piece of information that I examined was that Republican candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz has donated over 12 million dollars to his own campaign, more than 75% of his total funding!</p>
    <p>Additionally, there was a large gap in the total number of individual donors for both candidates. John Fetterman has risen a little under 6 million dollars from over 80000 individual donors. By contrast, Dr. Oz has risen over 2 million dollars from under 3000 donors. My findings point to the conclusion that although Fetterman has more individual donors than Dr. Oz, Oz is able to raise more money per donor. </p>
    <p>There are wide reaching implications that we can reach from my data. First, although much of Fetterman's money comes from individual donors, a large portion of it comes from various Political Action Committees that may have ultirior movites behund their funding. Secondly, Dr. Oz's ability to launch a successful campaign on the back of mostly his own money shows that financial well-being can act as both a boon and a barrier towards political power. </p>
